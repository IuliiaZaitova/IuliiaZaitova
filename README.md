## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a PhD student in Computational Linguistics with 5+ years of experience working on machine learning applications in language technology. My research focuses on **large language models**, **cross-lingual transfer**, and **non-compositionality**.

I work with both **text-based** and **speech-based** models and am passionate about making NLP and AI systems more inclusive, explainable, and effective across languages.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, Bash, R  
- **ML/NLP Frameworks:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK  
- **Data & Evaluation:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, langchain  
- **Other tools:** Git, LaTeX, Unix CLI, Docker

## 🔬 Current Projects

- 🧠 **Idiomatic Translation with LLMs** – Fine-tuning and evaluating multilingual models (LLama, DeepSeek, Whisper, SeamlessM4T, BERT-based models) on idiom-rich corpora across Slavic and Germanic languages.  
- 🔊 **Speech-Text Model Comparison** – Comparing performance of speech vs. text models on syntactic and semantic evaluation tasks.  
- 🌍 **Receptive Multilingualism** – Studying the impact of script, context, and phrase compositionality in cross-lingual comprehension and machine translation.
